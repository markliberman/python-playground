# Score the similarity of two files
This was a simple exercise to write a python routine to compare the text in two files for similarity.  The rules were that I could not import any libraries.

## Run textCompare
To run this routine, from the textCompare directory, issue the following command:

```python3 textCompare.py```

This will compare two hard coded filenames: file1.txt to file2.txt, and print a score between 0 and 1.
0 means the text in the files are not alike, 1 means they are identical.

If you want to compare two different files just copy new files into file1.txt and/or file2.txt (or edit the file contents).
