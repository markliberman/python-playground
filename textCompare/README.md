# Score the similarity of two files
To run this routine, from the textCompare directory, issue the following command:

python3 textCompare.py

This will compare two hard coded filenames: file1.txt to file2.txt, and return a score between 0 and 1.
0 means the text in the files are not alike, 1 means they are identical.
